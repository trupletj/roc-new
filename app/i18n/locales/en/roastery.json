  "main_text": "In 2016, we embarked on our coffee roasting journey at our branch. With dedication and passion, we honed our craft, meticulously roasting coffee to perfection. Recognizing the need to expand and improve, we took a significant step in 2018 by establishing our own roastery and warehouse.<br/><br/>This milestone allowed us to amplify our capabilities and further develop our expertise. Embracing a relentless pursuit of excellence, we continuously pushed the boundaries of technology and innovation. In 2023, our commitment bore fruit as we proudly installed the cutting-edge G75 roastery machine, a remarkable addition that elevated our coffee production to new heights.<br/><br/>Now, our factory operates at full capacity, serving as the heart of our operations. It encompasses not only the roastery, where our skilled team meticulously crafts each batch, but also features dedicated areas for espresso machine maintenance, a state-of-the-art coffee lab, and engaging training and cupping sessions. This comprehensive approach ensures that every aspect of our coffee production, from start to finish, receives the utmost care and attention to detail.",
